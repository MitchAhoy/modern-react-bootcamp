## Solution
This exercise wasn't too much of an issue. I used 0 to represent heads and 1 to represent tails. From here just pick a random number between 1 and 2 using Math.random(). Then displayed a different image depending on the result. Kept track of the current coin in the state.

## What could have been done better
After watching the instructor do it there weren't any major differences - happy with this one (super simple exercise)

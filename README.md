## In this repo you will see all of my documentation and tracking for completing Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/)
I began documenting my experience, problems, solutions and learnings from section 9. This is mostly so that I can look back and see exactly I've covered, learned and also it's motivating to see progress.

### All of the exercies that have been completed in this were done by myself 100% - I will not (have not) -- haven't completed it just yet at the time of writing this -- copy the instructor's code to complete the exercises. This is a little painful as I often get stuck for hour on an issue... BUT! I know it's going to make me a better React developer at the end of the day.
